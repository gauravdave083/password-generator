# Password Generator

This project is a simple password generator built with React. It allows users to generate strong, secure passwords based on their desired criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of **React Hooks** such as `useState` and `useEffect` for managing component state and side effects. It also highlights React's ability to build functional and dynamic user interfaces while emphasizing core React concepts like state management and event handling.

## Features:
- Customizable password length
- Options to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- Dynamic password strength display
- Copy password to clipboard

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand how **React states** and **hooks** can be applied in real-world applications.
